<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The people of New Yorker use the 311 system to report complaints about the non-emergency problems to local authorities. Various agencies in New York are assigned these problems. The Department of Housing Preservation and Development of New York City is the agency that processes 311 complaints that are related to housing and buildings.
<br> In the last few years, the number of 311 complaints coming to the Department of Housing Preservation and Development has increased significantly. Although these complaints are not necessarily urgent, the large volume of complaints and the sudden increase is impacting the overall efficiency of operations of the agency.
<br> Therefore, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development has approached your organization to help them manage the large volume of 311 complaints they are receiving every year. 
<br> The agency needs analysis and insights into which type of complaint should it focus on; any particular set of boroughs, ZIP codes, or streets to look into and to build a predictive model for prediction of the type of complaints
